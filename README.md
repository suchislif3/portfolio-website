# Portfolio Website

[Live Demo](https://suchislif3.github.io/portfolio-website/)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About the project

This is my first portfolio website as a software developer. I decided to use NextJS and styled components, in order to learn something new, while making it.
The project is based on [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPaLnMw2i_0) with the intention to make it my own.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo by running `git clone https://github.com/suchislif3/portfolio-website`
2. `cd portfolio-website`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
